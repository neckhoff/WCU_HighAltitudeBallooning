              In April 2022, Dr. Enrique Gomez, Nathan Eckhoff, and Ian Green
              met with the engineering faculty members in charge of establishing
              capstone projects. We discussed evolving the research Nathan and
              Ian were completing in to a capstone project for the 2022 - 2023
              school year. The Twiggs Space Labs CanSat and QB2 were used as
              examples of stepping stones to assist in learning the basics of
              satellite design. Starting in August 2022, Drew Britt, Austin
              Caudle, and Jared Holland joined our team. We began by researching
              common probelms encountered by spacecraft in deep space
              environments: radiation that can disrupt electronics and
              experiments, thermal loads, micrometeorite impacts, vibrations
              experienced during rocket powered flight and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of September, we met with Destination SPACE LLC and
              Twiggs Space Labs to discuss our progress and gather
              recommendations on our path forwards. We were told that while the
              reserach of the systems listed above were important, our it would
              be best for our fledgling program to take a more itertive approach
              and create a more rapid prototype so we can start testing on high
              altitude balloons. The electrical engineers also began designing
              circuts for our CPU, PSU, and Communications boards at this time.
              <!--Since our faculty mentor from the College of Engineering and Technology was on a personal business, trip, and our other faculty mentor from outside the College of Engineering and Technology was not too familiar with the structure of organization that the students were taught, it was up to us to find the compromise between the project management we had learned and the very iterative approach on a tight budget we were being told to follow.-->

              Our electrical engineers began working on a Computer Processing
              Unit, Power Supply Unit, and Communications custom Printed Circuit
              Boards. The mechanical engineers began iterating through a 6U
              CubeSat frame designed based on the 6U CubeSat specifications
              found via Rocket Lab documentation. We wanted to keep the
              footprint of the interior components of the CubeSat small so
              future teams didn't need to resdiesgn the internal layout fo fit
              more complex components. After a few iterations, we converted the
              design into a 3D printable version so we didn't need to pay for
              replacement metal incase we lost the payload duriing a balloon
              flight. 3D printing a frame takes less cost and time to
              manufacture and assemble versus mutiple sheet metal frames. At the
              end of the Fall 2022 semester, we had the 3D printed frame
              manufactured and partially assembled and components ordered for
              the custom printed circuit boards.

              Before the Spring 2023 semester started, we were planning on
              launching a tethered balloon to test the thermal loads on the
              eight corners of the 3D printed frame. Unfortunately, due to high
              winds throughout the week, we were not comfortable enough to
              perform a tethered balloon flight with limited resources available
              in case the tether broke. On January 17th, 2023, when the semester
              started, Nathan Eckhoff retrieved the supplies that had arrived
              over Winter Break from the College of Engineering and Technology
              storeroom for printed circuit board assembly in the lab space. On
              January 23rd, 2023 the Computer Processing Unit, Power Supply
              Unit, and Communications custom printed circuit boards were
              completed but untested. Around this time, Ian Green began
              redesigning the High Energy Particle Detector, which included
              testing of the MIT CosmicWatch Muon Detector against an
              oscilloscope to further refine the design. Jared Holland started
              developping hte firmware and software that was used in testing the
              Teensy Microcontroller and Communication boards.

              We decided to perform a benchtop test of all subsystems on March
              6th, 2023, however, in troubleshooting an communication error
              between the Teensy Microcontroller and the Long Range Radio
              Module, a short killed the Microcontroller. The team decided to
              meet on March 6th, despite no benchtop test taking place to
              discuss next steps and the final deliverables for the project. It
              was decided that communication between the existing subsystems, a
              High Energy Particle Detector that could detect and log particle
              events, and integration of all electrical components into a 2U
              CubeSat frame would suffice as final deliverables for this
              Capstone project. After returning from Spring Break Jared Holland
              updated the software of the Teensy Microcontroller and designed a
              2U CubeSat frame that would be integrated with the printed circuit
              boards. Drew Britt designed a sensor board with ports for external
              sensors that could be mounted to the CubeSat and align with the
              Teensy's Analog output pins. Additionally, the sensor board had a
              MicroSD card port integrated with it to overcome the datalogging
              issues we were facing.

              By the beginning of April, the final revision of all boards and
              components had been ordered, including the new sensor board and
              particle dectector board. Assembly of these boards began, but some
              key components were intentionally left off to minimize their
              chance of shorting during testing. Nathan Eckhoff and Jared
              Holland worked in the College of Engineering and Technology's
              Machine Shop to manufacture the panels needed for the 2U grame out
              of 6061 Aluminum Sheet Metal. A WaterJet was used to cut out the
              panels, a CNC machine to precisely drill holes, and a wheel
              grinder to grind the welding edges down to 45 degrees. Jared
              Holland and Rapid Center Engineer Shawn Lyvers then worked to weld
              the manufacutered panels together into the final assembly of the
              2U CubeSat. Jared Holland and Ian Green then worked together to
              test and troubleshoot the problems with the boards. Upon project
              completion, Nathan had assembled the completed Printed Circuit
              Boards onto a PETG Circuit Sled and mounted the Sled into the
              completed 2U CubeSat Frame. While the Teensy Microcontroller
              worked by itself and power was drawn from the Iron Phosphate
              Batteries, the external SD card port on the Sensor board did not
              work due to incorrect trace routings to the pins, the
              Communications chip was shorted, and the High Energy Particle
              Detector recieved incorrect compontents and couldn't physically
              work. However, the theoretical design of the High Energy Particle
              Detector does work as intended as provided by the following link
